# Bot General Framework
This is a <b>general purpose bot framework</b> that aims at generalizing and simplifying <b>bot frameworks</b>.

Go to the [documentation](docs/index.md) to know more on how to set up the framework for yourself.

## Cross compatibility
One of `bot general framework`'s objective is to generalize bot components such that <b>one codebase can be written</b> for many platforms.

<b>No functionality may be implemented if it cannot comply with cross-compatibility</b>.

## Simplicity
One fundamental principle around the project is simplicity. The codebase for a bot built with this library should be easy to read and understand, even without any knowledge of this very tool.

On the other hand, the implementation code in <b>C#</b> must be <b>well-documented</b> and <b>easy to read</b>. Inheritance is allowed where strictly needed.

`prefer composition over inheritance`

## Contribution
Contributing to the project is welcome when it follows all the above principles.

The creation of a code of conduct is on the agenda. For now feel free to pull request any changes and be as thorough as possible in commit messages.

Please, commit changes gradually to facilitate code reviews.
